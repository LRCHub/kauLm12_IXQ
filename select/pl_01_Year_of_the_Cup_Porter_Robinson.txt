It's none of my goddamn business
what's in the cup
But,
it's a beautiful thing then?
But, it's not a beautiful thing
because nobody knows
what's in the cup
That's the whole thing
Unless you come up and drink
what's in my cup then,
how can you say
it's a beautiful thing?
Also, when people drink alcohol
they react
So, whatever the hell is
in my cup,
the only reaction
that did was got more popular,
more successful
Did a lot more things
that I've ever done
Picked up a guitar,
learned to put
on the Auto-Tune's
and stretched my voice
I probably should pick
that cup back up
I swore not to care
but on that night
I couldn't help it
I took all of my shame
on a random guy
who probably liked me
And that night,
it was the obvious first time
you were disappointed
I spewed out
that irresponsible mantra,
I'm sorry I'm like this
What the hell was in his cup?
Whatever he was drinking
must've been a motherfuckin'
success potion
That's why I tell people,
fuck you and whatever was
in my cup
Suck my dick,
I'm gonna keep drinking it,
bitch
Aha, something's in the air
like vanilla
I got on my Facebook
And that time I had the courage
to call her
and tell her that I loved her
I guess that screaming
at my audience works
and everyone likes it
I dreamed of cutting
Achilles' heel
Wanting people to like me
Don't judge me, tryna say, yeah,
he should've put the cup down
Why? What did he do wrong?
Name it
He was on 60 Minutes
with- 60 Minutes
with Katie Couric, was you?
No
How many people understand that,
don't judge me
I can't go to sleep
'cause my mind keeps ringing
with times that I
Laid out everything wrong me
upon stage,
it's embarrassing
Fuck you, you don't deserve me,
the bus went totally silent
Help me,
what I was meant to say was
That I matched my teeth right
in front of you
Yeah, I kinda put the cup down
for a minute
But um, ain't nothing in the cup
right now but some wine
I drink Dulche, that's about it
that's the only thing in the cup
right now
But honestly
I asked you, if I never changed,
would you love me?
Expecting the negative, clever,
turning the question
around to me was obvious
Hate this version of me that was
safe and sanitised thoroughly
You think you'll let people down
and divine some perfect apology
The answer was obvious
The answer was obvious
The answer was obvious
The answer was obvious
What's in the cup?
Is it really none of
my goddamn business?
