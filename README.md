[00:09.08] It's none of my goddamn business what's in the cup
[00:11.95] But it's a beautiful thing, man
[00:13.53] But it's not a beautiful thing because nobody knows what's in the cup
[00:18.43] That's the whole thing
[00:19.08] Unless you come up and drink what's in my cup
[00:21.05] Then how can you say it's a beautiful thing?
[00:24.15] Also, when people drink alcohol, they react
[00:29.97] So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did
[00:32.02] Was got more popular, more successful
[00:35.71] Did a lot more things that I've ever done
[00:38.31] Picked up a guitar, learned how to play it
[00:39.95] Learned how to put on the Auto-Tunes and stretched my voice
[00:43.06] I probably should pick that cup back up
[01:02.56] 
[01:02.22] I swore not to care, but on that night, I couldn't help it
[01:09.62] I took out all of my shame on a random guy who probably liked me
[01:17.23] And that night, it was the obvious first time you were disappointed
[01:25.11] I spewed out that irresponsible mantra, "I'm sorry I'm like this"
[01:57.61] 
[01:33.57] "What the hell was in his cup?
[01:35.42] Whatever he was drinking must be a motherfuckin' success potion"
[01:39.63] That's why I tell people, "Fuck you and whatever was in my cup
[01:42.83] Suck my dick, I'm gon' keep drinking it, bitch"
[02:06.33] 
[01:48.78] Ah, "Something's in the air like vanilla", I got on my Facebook
[01:56.35] And that time, I had the courage to call her and tell her that I loved her
[02:04.09] I guess that screaming at my audience works and everyone likes it
[02:11.74] I dreamed of cutting my Achilles' heel: wanting people to like me
[02:44.24] 
[02:21.09] Don't judge me, tryna say, "Yeah, he should've put the cup down"
[02:25.07] Why? What did he do wrong? Name it
[02:28.19] He was on 60 Minutes with, he was on 60 Minutes with Katie Couric
[02:31.18] Was you? No
[02:33.20] I'm just tryna make people understand that, don't judge me
[03:02.20] 
[02:35.73] I can't go to sleep 'cause my mind keeps ringing with times that I
[02:43.27] Laid out everything wrong with me up on stage, it's embarrassing
[02:51.16] "Fuck you, you don't deserve me," the bus went totally silent
[02:58.56] And "help me" was what I meant to say as I gnashed my teeth right in front of you
[03:39.06] 
[03:08.71] Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute, but um
[03:12.64] Ain't nothing in the cup right now but some wine, I drink Dolce
[03:18.22] That's about it, that's the only thing in the cup right now, but honestly
[03:54.72] 
[03:21.97] I asked you if I never changed, would you love me? Expecting the negative
[03:29.91] Clever, turning the question around to me was obvious
[03:37.75] I hate this version of me that was safe and sanitized thoroughly
[03:45.58] You think you'll let people down and divine some perfect apology
[03:55.33] The answer was obvious
[03:58.89] The answer was obvious
[04:03.15] The answer was obvious
[04:06.86] The answer was obvious
[04:14.41] What's in the cup? Is it really none of my goddamn business?
